                But the new watches are flatter too, so      the volume of each version     is no larger than its older equivalent. The Series 4 is 10,7mm thick, down from the 3's 11,4mm - so just three-quarters of a millimetre has been shaved off. Is that noticeable? It feels like it is, and a random sample of colleagues shown two wrists with two watches all correctly named the thicker model. There have been some other, less obvious changes to the physical design. The Digital Crown dial offers (optional) haptic feedback as it's turned, which is more satisfying and possibly even more accurate to use; the old dial feels lightweight and floaty in comparison. The side button has a lower profile - it's now flush with the side of the case rather than raised a millimetre or so above it - which we find more attractive without being any harder to find without looking, since you orient by the position of the dial, not by seeking out the raised button.
